## 🛡️ Security Best Practices (For Contributors)

When contributing to Cygnuz ERP, please follow these security guidelines:

### Authentication & Authorization
```php
// Always check permissions
if (!$user->can('view-sensitive-data')) {
    abort(403);
}

// Use Laravel's built-in authentication
Auth::check()
Auth::user()
```

### Database Security
```php
// Always use parameterized queries
$users = DB::select('SELECT * FROM users WHERE email = ?', [$email]);

// Use Eloquent ORM
$user = User::where('email', $email)->first();

// Never do this:
$users = DB::select("SELECT * FROM users WHERE email = '$email'"); // VULNERABLE!
```

### Input Validation
```php
// Always validate input
$validated = $request->validate([
    'email' => 'required|email|max:255',
    'password' => 'required|min:8|confirmed',
    'file' => 'required|file|mimes:pdf,doc|max:2048'
]);

// Sanitize output
{{ e($userInput) }}  // Blade escaping
{!! clean($htmlContent) !!}  // For HTML content
```

### File Uploads
```php
// Validate file types and sizes
$request->validate([
    'document' => 'required|file|mimes:pdf,jpg,png|max:10240'
]);

// Store outside public directory
$path = $request->file('document')->store('documents', 'private');

// Never trust file extensions
$mimeType = $file->getMimeType();
```

### API Security
```php
// Rate limiting
Route::middleware('throttle:60,1')->group(function () {
    // API routes
});

// API authentication
Route::middleware('auth:sanctum')->group(function () {
    // Protected routes
});
```

### Sensitive Data
```php
// Never log sensitive data
Log::info('User login', ['email' => $email]); // OK
Log::info('User login', ['password' => $password]); // NEVER!

// Use encryption for sensitive data
$encrypted = Crypt::encryptString($sensitiveData);
$decrypted = Crypt::decryptString($encrypted);

// Environment variables
config('services.api.key'); // OK
env('API_KEY'); // Only in config files!
```

### Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) Prevention
```blade
{{-- Always escape user input --}}
{{ $userInput }}

{{-- Only use unescaped for trusted content --}}
{!! $trustedHtml !!}

{{-- JavaScript context --}}
<script>
    var data = @json($data);
</script>
```

### CSRF Protection
```blade
{{-- Forms must include CSRF token --}}
<form method="POST">
    @csrf
    {{-- form fields --}}
</form>

{{-- AJAX requests --}}
$.ajaxSetup({
    headers: {
        'X-CSRF-TOKEN': $('meta[name="csrf-token"]').attr('content')
    }
});
```

## 🔍 Security Headers

Recommended security headers for production:

```php
// In middleware or .htaccess
X-Frame-Options: DENY
X-Content-Type-Options: nosniff
X-XSS-Protection: 1; mode=block
Strict-Transport-Security: max-age=31536000; includeSubDomains
Content-Security-Policy: default-src 'self'
Referrer-Policy: strict-origin-when-cross-origin
Permissions-Policy: geolocation=(), microphone=(), camera=()
```
